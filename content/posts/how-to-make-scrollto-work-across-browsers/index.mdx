Earlier today I finished building the date and timepicker component for a side project. When a user
navigates to the component, they'll see a list of their upcoming event dates. They'll have the
option to edit or add a new date. By doing so, an editor will appear, which I want to scroll into
view, smoothly.

In this post I will walk through my implementation for creating the `scrollTo` effect using a bit of
Javascript and CSS transforms.

Here's what I want to happen:

<Image src={demo} alt="Scroll animation demo with date and timepicker" shadow />

Using `window.scrollTo` was my first quick, go to solution. Especially since the nav, side menu and preview (black bar for now 😬) are fixed components, a simple `window.scrollTo` will
only scroll the center section.

```js
const onClick = () => {
  // Get the top position of the element we want to scroll to
  const { top } = document
    .querySelector('.editor-component')
    .getBoundingClientRect()

  window.scrollTo({ top, behavior: 'smooth' })
}
```

There are two problems with this solution:

1. Safari's `scrollTo` with `behavior: 'smooth'` doesn't scroll
2. Even if it did, we can't control the speed or easing of the scroll

## Solution

We're going to build a custom `scroll` function that recreates the scrolling effect. Let's begin by
writing how we'd like to use this function:

```js
scroll({
  base: document.querySelector('.element-that-we-want-to-move'),
  target: document.querySelector('.element-that-we-want-to-move-to'),
  callback: () => {
    // Do something after it's done animating.
  },
  // offset the scroll amount.
  // -120 will scroll to 120px before the viewport top.
  offset: -120,
})
```

When we call `scroll`, we need to pass it an object of options:

- `base` is the element that we want to apply a CSS translate to. This can be any DOM element —
  `document.body`, `document.querySelector('...')`, a React `ref.current`, etc.
- `target` is the DOM element that we want to scroll to.
- `callback` is an optional function our `scroll` will call after the animation is complete.
- `duration` is an optional number for how long the animation will last.
- `easingFn` is the optional function we will use to calculate animation easing. I just use the ones found
  [here](https://gist.github.com/gre/1650294).
- `offset` is an optional number value to offset the end position by a certain amount. For example,
  an offset of -120 will scroll the `base` 120px from the top of the viewport.

Let's implement the function. First, we add the arguments, applying some defaults values.

```js
export const scroll = ({
  base,
  target,
  callback,
  duration = 500,
  easingFn = t => t * t * t * t,
  offset = 0,
}) => {}
```

When `scroll` is called, we want to define and cache a few variables:

```js
export const scroll = (/* ... */) => {
  // Get target's position
  const target = t.getBoundingClientRect()

  // Cache the position of the target element
  // relative to the top of the document.
  const cachePosition = target.top + offset + window.pageYOffset

  // Cache current time in milliseconds
  const startTime = Date.now()

  // We will be using requestAnimationFrame (rAF) for animating,
  // so we'll need to keep a reference of the returned rAF id.
  let animationId
}
```

Next, we will write the function that `requestAnimationFrame` will call recursively:

```js
// ...

const animate = () => {
  const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime

  if (elapsed < duration) {
    const ease = easingFn(elapsed / duration)

    // If easingFn returns a value greater than 1,
    // just return the target.top * -1 to prevent overshooting the element.
    const translate =
      ease > 1 ? cachePosition * -1 : ease * (target.top + offset) * -1

    // Apply a transform to the base element
    base.style.transform = `translateY(${translate}px)`

    animationId = requestAnimationFrame(animate)
  } else {
    setTimeout(() => {
      cancelAnimationFrame(animationId)
      base.style.transform = 'translateY(0px)'
      window.scrollTo({ top: cachePosition })
      callback()
    }, 0)
  }
}

// ...
```

A few things are happening here:

When `animate` is called, we take the value that `Date.now()` returns and compare it to the cached
`startTime` value. If we're within the `duration` that we set, we'll calculate an amount to apply a
CSS transform and apply that amount to the `base` element.

If we've passed the `duration`, we'll cancel the animation as well as do a little trick:

When we animate the `base` element, what we're really doing is just creating an illusion that the
page is scrolling. Once we've scrolled to the `target` position, we do an immediate switch by
removing the CSS transform and applying `window.scrollTo({ top: cachePosition })`. The users won't see the switch because the translated position
of the `base` is exactly where the `window.scrollTo` would go to originally.

I applied a `setTimeout` with a time of 0 because in Safari, we'll get a slight flash when we
execute the switch between removing the CSS and applying `window.scrollTo`. I believe it has
something to do with the [event loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) that causes the
issue. 🧐

Let's finish the function by actually calling `animate`:

```js
export const scroll = (/* ... */) => {
  // ...

  const animate = () => {
    // ...
  }

  animate()
}
```

And there we have it! A `window.scrollTo` with smooth scrolling alternative that uses CSS transforms and requestAnimationFrame to
create an illusion of page scrolling that works across all browsers.
