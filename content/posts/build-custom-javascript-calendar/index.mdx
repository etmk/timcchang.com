I recently came across the need to build a datepicker for a side project. Since I had always used
some type of datepicker library, I figured it would be fun to build one from scratch, using native
web APIs to handle data specific to a calendar.

In this post we will build a custom React hook, `useCalendar`, that returns all the data we will
need to build a custom calendar UI.

Our goal is to be able to call the hook like this:

```tsx
const {
  // an array of dates for the current month, the trailing dates from the
  // previous month, and the beginning dates of the next month.
  dates,
  // a prop getter to add `onClick` functionality to each date we render.
  getToggleProps,
  // function to toggle previous month.
  togglePrevious,
  // function to toggle previous month.
  toggleNext,
  // function to check if a current day is in focus.
  isActive,
  // function that returns information regarding the current month.
  getInfo,
} = useCalendar()
```

And to use it like this:

```tsx
// ...

return (
  <CalendarContainer>
    <Header>
      <Toggle onClick={togglePrevious}>Previous</Toggle>
      <Toggle onClick={toggleNext}>Next</Toggle>
    </Header>
    <CalendarGrid>
      {dates.map(date => (
        <Day id={date.id}>
          <DayToggle
            {...getToggleProps({
              date,
              onClick: value => {
                // value will be a formatted string of the current date selected (Tue Apr 28, 2020)
              },
            })}
            isActive={isActive(date)}
          >
            {date.day}
          </DayToggle>
        </Day>
      ))}
    </CalendarGrid>
  </CalendarContainer>
)
```

We will be using Typescript in this project. My usage is really basic — I'm trying to incorporate
it into my projects as a way to learn, so please feel free to send me suggestions and tips. :)

A live demo of this can be found on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/23k7wojv7p).

## Let's get started

We'll work in a file named `use-calendar.tsx`.

In the file, we'll create the types that we will be using to describe our data:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

type CalendarDayType = {
  id?: string
  year: string
  month: string
  day: string
}

type CalendarStateType = {
  dates: CalendarDayType[]
  currentlyFocusedDay: CalendarDayType | null
  currentCalendar: {
    year: string
    month: string
  }
}
```

Each `CalendarDay` will consist of four properties: `id`, `year`, `month`, and `day` and they will be of
type `string`.

`id` is optional (We'll be creating unique ids so users can set them as they `key` property when
they map over `dates`. More on this later).

Our hook's entire state is described by `CalendarStateType`, where:

- `date` represents an array of `CalendarDayType`s
- `currentlyFocusedDay` is either a `CalendarDayType` or `null`. It is `null` when we don't have a date selected.
- `currentCalendar` is an object which has two `string` properties, `year` and `month`, which represent the current calendar in view.

Next, we'll set up our function:

```tsx
// ...

export default function useCalendar({
  initialDay,
}: { initialDay?: CalendarDayType } = {}) {}
```

We want to allow users to initialize the hook with an optional day. We type the optional
`initialDay` prop as a `CalendarDayType`. So if a user passes an initial day that does not match our
`CalendarDayType`, Typescript will throw an error.

## Managing State

To manage the state of our hook, we will use `useReducer`. I use this hook really often — the
API allows us to manage state in a very clear and succinct way.

```tsx
const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState)
```

`useReducer` will return the current state and a dispatch function, which we call whenever we
need to make a state update. It takes a `reducer` function, as well as an `initialState` object.
Let's define them:

We'll declare `initialState` before our `useReducer`

```tsx
const today = new Date()
let initialState: CalendarStateType

if (initialDay) {
  initialState = {
    dates: getCalendarDates(initialDay.year, initialDay.month),
    currentlyFocusedDay: initialDay,
    currentCalendar: {
      year: initialDay.year,
      month: initialDay.month,
    },
  }
} else {
  const year = format(today.getFullYear())
  const month = format(today.getMonth() + 1)
  initialState = {
    dates: getCalendarDates(year, month),
    currentlyFocusedDay: null,
    currentCalendar: {
      year,
      month,
    },
  }
}

// const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState)
```

And create our `reducer` function outside of our hook:

```tsx
// export default function useCalendar(...) {...}

const reducer = (
  state: CalendarStateType,
  action: {
    type: string
    payload?: any
  }
) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'TOGGLE_DAY':
      return state
    case 'TOGGLE_NEXT_MONTH':
      return state
    case 'TOGGLE_PREVIOUS_MONTH':
      return state
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

We will define the logic within each case later. But for now know that our `reducer` function will
manipulate and update our state depending on the `type`, always giving us the most up to date state.

Let's take a look at our `initialState` object and dissect what is happening.

`initialState` is of `CalendarStateType`, so it must contain:

- an array of `dates`
- the `currentlyFocusedDay`
- a `currentCalendar` object.

Let's think about how to get an array of `dates`. A calendar is represented by a grid of seven
columns, starting from Sunday, ending at Saturday:

<Image src={calendar1} alt="calendar" />

We'll need to:

1. Calculate the number of days in the current month
2. Calculate the index of the first day of the month
3. If index > 0, that is how many days we need to show from the previous month
4. Calculate the index of last day of month
5. If index < 6, subtract the index from 6 and that is how many days we need to show from the next month
6. Prepend previous month's trailing dates (if any)
7. Append next month's starting dates (if any)

Here is that in code:

```tsx
const getCalendarDates = (year: string, month: string) => {
  const calcNumberOfDays = (year: string, month: string) =>
    new Date(Number(year), Number(month), 0).getDate()

  const calcFirstDayIndex = (year: string, month: string) =>
    new Date(`${year}-${month}-01T03:24:00`).getDay()
  const calcLastDayIndex = (year: string, month: string, lastDay: number) =>
    new Date(`${year}-${month}-${lastDay}T03:24:00`).getDay()

  const previousMonthDates = []
  const currentMonthDates = []
  const nextMonthDates = []

  const numDaysInCurrentMonth = calcNumberOfDays(year, month)
  const indexOfDayOne = calcFirstDayIndex(year, month)
  const indexOfLastDay = calcLastDayIndex(year, month, numDaysInCurrentMonth)

  // Setup up previous month's dates.
  if (indexOfDayOne > 0) {
    const previousMonth =
      Number(month) - 1 === 0 ? format(12) : format(Number(month) - 1)
    const previousYear =
      previousMonth === format(12)
        ? format(Number(year) - 1)
        : format(Number(year))
    const numDaysInPreviousMonth = calcNumberOfDays(previousYear, previousMonth)

    let day = numDaysInPreviousMonth - indexOfDayOne
    for (let i = 0; i < Array(indexOfDayOne).length; i++) {
      day++
      previousMonthDates.push({
        id: `${previousYear}${previousMonth}${day}`,
        year: previousYear,
        month: previousMonth,
        day: format(day),
      })
    }
  }

  // Setup current months' dates.
  for (let i = 0; i < Array(numDaysInCurrentMonth).length; i++) {
    let day = format(i + 1)
    currentMonthDates.push({
      id: `${year}${month}${day}`,
      year,
      month,
      day,
    })
  }

  // Setup next month's dates.
  if (indexOfLastDay !== 6) {
    const nextMonth =
      Number(month) + 1 !== 13 ? format(Number(month) + 1) : format(1)
    const nextYear =
      nextMonth === format(1) ? format(Number(year) + 1) : format(year)

    for (let i = 0; i < Array(6 - indexOfLastDay).length; i++) {
      let day = format(i + 1)
      nextMonthDates.push({
        id: `${nextYear}${nextMonth}${day}`,
        year: nextYear,
        month: nextMonth,
        day,
      })
    }
  }

  return [...previousMonthDates, ...currentMonthDates, ...nextMonthDates]
}
```

The `currentlyFocusedDay` is just the `initialDay` passed by the user or we just set it to
`null`.

And lastly `currentCalendar` is defined by the user's `initialDay` or we take the current month from
the browser and set that as the value.

You may notice the `format()` function. This helper function takes a value and returns
that value as a string, prepending a '0' if the number value is less than 10. So, a value of 1 will
be returned as "01", 2 will be "02", and so on.

```tsx
const format = (value: string | number): string =>
  Number(value) < 10 ? `0${Number(value)}` : `${value}`
```

Okay, at this point, on load, our hook returns dates that we can render. Next, we will begin creating the
functions that we expose to the user which manipulates state to make their calendar dynamic and interactive.

## Functions To Expose

We are going to define the following functions, which will give the hook user full control of the
calendar:

1. `getToggleProps`: prop getter to attach `onClick` handler to each day

2. `togglePrevious`: function to toggle previous month

3. `toggleNext`: function to toggle next month

4. `isActive`: function to check if a current day is in focus

5. `getInfo`: function that returns information regarding the current month

Let's define `getToggleProps`:

```tsx
// ...
const getToggleProps = ({
  date,
  onClick,
  ...rest
}: {
  date: CalendarDayType
  onClick?: any
}) => ({
  onClick: () => {
    if (onClick) {
      const formattedDate = new Date(
        `${date.year}-${date.month}-${date.day}T03:24:00`
      ).toDateString()
      onClick(formattedDate)
    }

    dispatch({
      type: 'TOGGLE_DAY',
      payload: {
        date,
      },
    })
  },
  ...rest,
})
```

This function will take a single object with properties `date` and optional `onClick` and return an
object of properties that will be spread onto an element.

We first check if an `onClick` is provided by the user — if it is, we'll call it with a
formatted date string of the currently selected date. Then, we'll call our `dispatch` function with
a type of `TOGGLE_DAY`.

Let's go back to our `reducer` function and define the state for `TOGGLE_DAY`:

```tsx
// ...

case 'TOGGLE_DAY':
  const { date } = action.payload
  return {
    ...state,
    currentlyFocusedDay: date,
    currentCalendar: {
      year: date.year,
      month: date.month,
    },
    dates:
      state.currentCalendar.month !== date.month ||
      state.currentCalendar.year !== date.year
        ? getCalendarDates(date.year, date.month)
        : state.dates,
  }

// ...
```

When a user clicks a day, what we want to do is update the `currentlyFocusedDay` to that day. If
they clicked on one of the previous or next month's day, we'll need to update the `currentCalendar`
as well as call `getCalendarDates` for the new month's `dates`.

Next, let's look at both `togglePrevious` and `toggleNext`. Both of these functions derive from a
higher order function, `toggle`:

```tsx
// ...

const toggle = (direction: 'PREVIOUS' | 'NEXT') => () => {
  switch (direction) {
    case 'PREVIOUS':
      dispatch({
        type: 'TOGGLE_PREVIOUS_MONTH',
      })
      break
    case 'NEXT':
      dispatch({
        type: 'TOGGLE_NEXT_MONTH',
      })
      break
    default:
      throw Error()
  }
}

// ...
```

Let's look at the dispatch function for both `TOGGLE_PREVIOUS_MONTH` and `TOGGLE_NEXT_MONTH`:

```tsx
// ...

case 'TOGGLE_NEXT_MONTH':
  const nextYear = getNext('NEXT_YEAR')(
    state.currentCalendar.month,
    state.currentCalendar.year
  )
  const nextMonth = getNext('NEXT_MONTH')(state.currentCalendar.month)

  return {
    ...state,
    currentCalendar: {
      year: nextYear,
      month: nextMonth,
    },
    dates: getCalendarDates(nextYear, nextMonth),
  }
case 'TOGGLE_PREVIOUS_MONTH':
  const previousYear = getNext('PREVIOUS_YEAR')(
    state.currentCalendar.month,
    state.currentCalendar.year
  )
  const previousMonth = getNext('PREVIOUS_MONTH')(
    state.currentCalendar.month
  )

  return {
    ...state,
    currentCalendar: {
      year: previousYear,
      month: previousMonth,
    },
    dates: getCalendarDates(previousYear, previousMonth),
}

// ...
```

In both these cases, we don't need to update the `currentlyFocusedDay`, since we're just changing
months. To calculate `nextMonth` and `previousMonth`, we'll also need the `nextYear`, and
`previousYear`.

Here's the idea:

- For the `previousMonth`, we'll need to check if the previous month's index isn't 0. If it
  is, we'll loop back to December at index 12.
- For the `nextMonth`, we implement the same logic but if th next month's index is 13, we'll
  loop back to January at index 1.
- For the `previousYear`, we'll need to check if the previous month's index is 0. If it is, that
  means we'll need to go back a year.
- For the `nextYear`, we'll need to check if the next month's index isn't 13. If it is, that means
  we'll need to go forward a year.

I opted for another higher ordered function implementation:

```tsx
// ...

const getNext = (
  direction: 'PREVIOUS_YEAR' | 'NEXT_YEAR' | 'PREVIOUS_MONTH' | 'NEXT_MONTH'
) => (currentMonth: string, currentYear?: string) => {
  const month = Number(currentMonth)
  const year = Number(currentYear)
  switch (direction) {
    case 'PREVIOUS_MONTH':
      return month - 1 === 0 ? format(12) : format(month - 1)
    case 'NEXT_MONTH':
      return month + 1 === 13 ? format(1) : format(month + 1)
    case 'PREVIOUS_YEAR':
      return month - 1 === 0 ? format(year - 1) : format(year)
    case 'NEXT_YEAR':
      return month + 1 === 13 ? format(year + 1) : format(year)
    default:
      throw Error()
  }
}

// ...
```

By now, our user will be able to navigate their calendar by toggling between months as well as days!

We'll implement a function, `isActive` to check whether a given day is the
`currentlyFocusedDay`:

```tsx
// ...

const isActive = (day: CalendarDayType) => {
  if (!state.currentlyFocusedDay) return false
  if (
    state.currentlyFocusedDay.month === day.month &&
    state.currentlyFocusedDay.day === day.day &&
    state.currentlyFocusedDay.year === day.year
  ) {
    return true
  }
}

// ...
```

We'll also implement a function, `getInfo`, which will return formatted information about the
calendar:

```tsx
const months = [
  { id: '01', full: 'January', shortened: 'Jan' },
  { id: '02', full: 'February', shortened: 'Feb' },
  { id: '03', full: 'March', shortened: 'Mar' },
  { id: '04', full: 'April', shortened: 'Apr' },
  { id: '05', full: 'May', shortened: 'May' },
  { id: '06', full: 'June', shortened: 'Jun' },
  { id: '07', full: 'July', shortened: 'Jul' },
  { id: '08', full: 'August', shortened: 'Aug' },
  { id: '09', full: 'September', shortened: 'Sep' },
  { id: '10', full: 'October', shortened: 'Oct' },
  { id: '11', full: 'November', shortened: 'Nov' },
  { id: '12', full: 'December', shortened: 'Dec' },
]

const getInfo = () => ({
  currentDate: {
    month:
      months[
        months.findIndex(
          month => format(month.id) === format(state.currentCalendar.month)
        )
      ],
    year: state.currentCalendar.year,
  },
})
```

And lastly, we expose our state and functions:

```tsx
// ...

return {
  dates: state.dates,
  getToggleProps,
  togglePrevious: toggle('PREVIOUS'),
  toggleNext: toggle('NEXT'),
  isActive,
  getInfo,
}
```
