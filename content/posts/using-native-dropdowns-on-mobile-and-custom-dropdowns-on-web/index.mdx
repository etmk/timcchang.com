While building a custom dropdown menu earlier today, I came across an interesting
solution for switching between a native dropdown menu while on a mobile device, and a custom
dropdown UI while on anything larger than a tablet.

The mobile experience for dropdowns and menus is quite nice, and the web version, though functional
and gets the job done, can be furthered customized to the look and feel on the app while maintaining
accessibility.

In this post I will walk through a process for creating a set of React Hooks that compose together
to build a timepicker. This timepicker will be able to switch between a custom UI on desktop
and the native web implementation on mobile.

Here's what we will build:

In order to make this we'll need to build a set of hooks that will each take care of and manage
specific state:

- `useMedia`
  A media query hook that wraps that returns a higher ordered function, giving us the current
  screen width.
- `useDropdown`
  Manages the visibility of our dropdown container.
