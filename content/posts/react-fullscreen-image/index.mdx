import Image from 'components/shared/img'
import demo from 'assets/images/react-fullscreen-image.gif'

While helping [@alexcarey.s](https://alexcarey.co/) build a simple portfolio site, we found a need
to create a full screen view of a few secondary portfolio images. So I thought why not build a
little library from scratch and try a compositional technique that I haven't before, with [compound
components](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks?ref=timcchang.com/blog/react-fullscreen-image/).

Here's how it looks with a grid of images:

<Image src={demo} alt="alexcarey.co portfolio demo" shadow />

In this post I will briefly walk through how I used compound components, hooks, and CSS transforms to get
the library to where it is currently at. The full repository is on [Github](https://github.com/timc1/react-fullscreen-image) and downloadable on
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fullscreen-image). A live demo can be found on
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/o9m59jj3oq) as well!

We'll cover:

1. UI/UX requirements
2. Why Compound Components
3. CSS Transform & Opacity For Image Scaling

## UI/UX Requirements

We want to render a list of images, in any order and depth in the component tree.

When an image is clicked, we want that image to scale from its current position to the fullscreen view.

Once it's in its fullscreen view, we want to be able to navigate using keyboard arrows or arrow buttons to the
previous and next images.

Finally, when we exit out of the image (using the escape key, exit button, or an outerclick) we'd like the current focused image to
animate down to the position where it is supposed to be.

For how to use the API, I wanted to make the developer experience as easy as possible — a
simple plug and play idea:

```tsx
import { ImageGroup, Image } from 'react-fullscreen-image'

function App() {
  return (
    {/* Wrap any number of <Image /> inside of an <ImageGroup /> */}
    <ImageGroup>
      <ul>
        {/* Replace any <img /> tags with <Image /> */}
        {images.map(image => (
          <li key={image}>
            <Image src={image.src} alt={image.alt} />
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </ImageGroup>
  )
}
```

## Why Compound Components

We want to render any number of images, at any depth level of the component tree, where each each
Image shares some implicit state. Each Image will need to know a few things:

- Am I currently focused? If I am, then we'll need to determine how we're going to animate in.
- Are we in fullscreen mode? If we're not, that means we need to animate the image in.
  If we are, then we'll need to immediately show the image instead, since we've already animated
  to fullscreen mode.

`ImageGroup` will manage the state for all of this, and pass it down to `Image` components as props.
By using a recursive implementation of `React.Children.map`, we're be able to capture every `Image`
component no matter where it's at in the component tree.

The image resizing calculation happens within `Image`. `Image`'s `useEffect` hook will update each
time its props update. `ImageGroup` will essentially say one of the following:

- "Hey Image, you're currently in focus. You need to animate in."
- "Hey Image, you're currently in focus, but you don't need to animate in since we're already in
  fullscreen mode"
- "Hey Image, you're not in focus, and the user just exited fullscreen mode so you should animate
  out"
- "Hey Image, you're not in focus anymore, but since the user just navigated to another image, we're
  still in fullscreen mode. In this case, just immediately go back to your original position"

Based on these cases, `Image` will handle each appropriately. This brings us to why I decided to
implement fullscreen using CSS transform and opacity.

## CSS Transform & Opacity For Image Scaling

Currently, what `Image` does is take a native `<img />` tag and
returns a component that wraps the `<img />` like so:

```tsx
// ...

return (
  <div className="fullscreen-container">
    <button className="fullscreen-btn">
      <div className="fullscreen-image--original">
        <img src={src} alt={alt} style={style} />
      </div>
      <div className="fullscreen-image--large">
        <img src={src} alt={alt} style={style} />
      </div>
    </button>
  </div>
)
```

You can see that we return two `<img />`s. Initially, the large image will be hidden with `opacity: 0`.
When `Image` is clicked, we calculate how much to scale the image to fill the viewport, change the
opacity, and take the large image and scale it to the calculated value.

Some fullscreen implementation I've seen, like Medium's, animates the image's height/width, butj
a transform implementation is
[cheaper](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/) and I think quite simpler since the browser will handle all the calculations for
when the image needs to scale down to its original position (with a simple `transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0)`.

\*\*I think in the next version of `react-fullscreen-image`, we can add an extra prop to
`Image` as `hdImgSrc` where the user can specify a higher quality version of the image for the
fullscreen version.

## Comments and Suggestions?

I'm pretty new to building libraries, working with Typescript, and creating packages. If you have suggestions/tips on
better implementation methods, testing, or just code in general I'd love to hear from you!
