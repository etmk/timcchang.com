While helping [@alexcarey.s](https://alexcarey.co/) build a simple portfolio site, we found a need
to create a full screen view of a few secondary portfolio images. So I thought why not build a
little library from scratch and try a compositional technique that I haven't before, with [compound
components](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks?ref=timcchang.com/blog/react-fullscreen-image/).

Here's how it looks with a grid of images:

# Image 1

In this post I will walk through the decisions made and steps taken that got us to the current
implementation.

We'll cover:

1. The UI/UX requirements
2. Building the `Image` component, which the user will replace with any `<img />` tags
3. Building the `ImageGroup` component, which will wrap any number of `Image` components
