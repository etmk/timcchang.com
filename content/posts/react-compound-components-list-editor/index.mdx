A few days ago I ran into a little problem while building out a UI that allow users to edit each individual
item from a list of items.

To better understand the problem, I decided to make a demo with the solution I came up with. Hope
this might help someone who is figuring out how to compose a similar type of component.

In this post we will briefly talk about why combining useReducer and compound components worked well
for this type of UI requirement.

The full repository can be found on [Github](https://github.com/timc1/dynamic-editor-demo/) and a
full demo can be found on [CodeSandbox](). If you have any questions going through the code, feel
free to send me an email or DM through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/timcchang)

## React.useReducer & compound components

Our goal is to render a list of "notes", where each note has two states: nonediting and editing. In
the nonediting state, the note will be displayed alongside toggles to edit and delete the note. In
the editing state, the note will be placed within a `textarea` with a toggle to go back to the
nonediting state and a toggle for saving the note.

Our main component, `<NotesApp />` will hold all visual state:

- `notes`: an array of `Note` objects

```js
// Returns a formatted Note object with a unique id.
function Note({ id, note }) {
  return {
    id: id || randomId(),
    note: note || '',
  }
}
```

- `isAddNewEditorShowing`: a boolean value to determine whether we should display an empty editor or
  not
- `currentEditingIndex`: a number value that represents which `<Note />` is in editing mode.

Nested within `<NotesApp />` is any number of `<Note />` components. Each `<Note />` component will only hold one piece of local state:

- `text` a string value representing the current "note"

`<NotesApp />`'s state is managed by a single `useReducer`:

```js
const initialState = {
  notes: [],
  isAddNewEditorShowing: false,
  currentEditingIndex: -1,
}

const notesAppActions = {
  toggleAddNewEditor: 'TOGGLE_ADD_NEW_EDITOR',
  toggleEditor: 'TOGGLE_EDITOR',
  addNewNote: 'ADD_NEW_NOTE',
  updateNote: 'UPDATE_NOTE',
  deleteNote: 'DELETE_NOTE',
}

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case notesAppActions.toggleAddNewEditor:
      return // ...
    case notesAppActions.toggleEditor:
      return // ...
    case notesAppActions.addNewNote:
      return // ...
    case notesAppActions.updateNote:
      return // ...
    case notesAppActions.deleteNote: {
      return // ...
    default:
      throw new Error(`No case for type ${action.type} found.`)
  }
}

export default function NotesApp() {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState)

  // ...
}
```

How will `<Note />` know when to be in editing or nonediting state? That is where compound
components come in!

Instead of just rendering `<NotesApp />`'s children, we'll run the children through a recursive
`React.Children.map`. If we run into a `<Note />` component, we'll pass additional props based
on `<NotesApp />` state that `<Note />` will use to determine how it should render.

```js
// Recursively map through each child; if the child has a displayName
// of 'Note', we'll add appropriate props to the component.
const mapPropsToChildren = children => {
  let indexOfComponent = 0
  const recursiveMap = child => {
    return React.Children.map(child, child => {
      if (!React.isValidElement(child)) {
        return child
      }
      if (child.type.displayName === 'Note') {
        child = React.cloneElement(child, {
          index: indexOfComponent,
          isInEditingMode: indexOfComponent === state.currentEditingIndex,
          dispatch,
        })

        indexOfComponent++
        return child
      }

      if (child.props.children) {
        child = React.cloneElement(child, {
          children: recursiveMap(child.props.children),
        })
      }

      return child
    })
  }

  return recursiveMap(children)
}
```

By passing props to `<Note />` directly in our render function using `React.Children.map` and
`React.cloneElement`, we can
have a dynamic number of `<Note />`s rendered, with the proper props passed to each. We also don't have to do additional work to pass props down. It simply just works
:)
