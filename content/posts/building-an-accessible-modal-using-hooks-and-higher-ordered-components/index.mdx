My upcoming side project is built with Next.js, which server side renders each page of the site.
While building a React modal window using ReactDOM's `createPortal` API, I ran into the problem of
not being able to create and inject a new `div` since `document` doesn't exist on the server.

In this post I will go over how I was able to create a `Modal` higher ordered component with
React Portal that bypasses server side rendering, plus a few more UI elements.

I will be using Typescript (new to Types, ping me to help üôÇ). A live demo of our `Modal` component can be found on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/4r86m3vqv9).

Let's get started!

## Requirements

Our modal will simply be a higher ordered component, where its children is rendered into a separate
`div` outside of the primary `<div id="app" />`.

Our modal will:

- Be able to go through server rendering without blowing up.
- Let the user manage the state for when the modal is open or closed.
- Always render an exit button; which will immediately be focused when the modal opens.
- Make all focusable children elements unfocusable when the modal isn't open,
  and vice versa with all focusable elements in our main app when the modal is open.
- Handle Escape key events when opened, effectively closing the modal.
- Freeze the overlayed content when the modal is opened, only allowing scroll to happen in the
  modal.

In a new `index.tsx` file, let's define the types and begin our `Modal` component:

```tsx
type ModalPropTypes = {
  children: React.ReactNode
  isOpen: boolean
  handleExit: () => any
  id: string
  root?: string
  focusAfterExit?: HTMLElement
}

export default function Modal({
  children,
  isOpen,
  handleExit,
  id,
  root,
  focusAfterExit,
}: ModalPropTypes): any {
  return null
}
```

Our `Modal` will take a few props:

- `children` - all the components nested within `Modal`
- `isOpen` - where ever a user uses `Modal`, they'll manage the state for whether it is open or not.
- `handleExit` - same with `isOpen`, the user will pass a function to toggle `isOpen` to `false`.
- `id` - a unique identifier for this specific `Modal` instance.
- `root` - the id of the root node that our React app is injected to. With create-react-app it's
  `app`, Next.js `__next`, and Gatsby `__gatsby`.

### Bypassing React Portal During Server Side Rendering

Let's first make sure our modal is only created when we're on the client. To do this, I paired a
`useRef` and `useEffect` together:

```tsx
// ...
const [hasUpdated, forceUpdate] = React.useState(false)
const modal = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)

React.useEffect(() => {
  modal.current = document.createElement('div')
  modal.current.id = id

  if (!document.body.querySelector(`#${id}`)) {
    document.body.prepend(modal.current)
  }

  if (!hasUpdated) forceUpdate(true)

  return () => {
    if (modal.current) document.body.removeChild(modal.current)
  }
}, [])

if (modal.current) {
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(
    <>
      <button
        className="exit-button"
        isShowing={isOpen}
        ref={exitButton}
        onClick={() => handleExit()}
      >
        Exit
      </ExitButton>
      {children}
    </>,
    modal.current
  )
}
return null

// ...
```

Let's break down what's happening.

`modal` is a reference to either a `div` or `null`. On the initial server render, we'll return null
since the value of `modal.current` is null.

Since `useEffect` runs after our component has already mounted, we can define `modal` in the effect,
and then call our custom `forceUpdate` function to rerender the component.

This next time around, `modal.current` is now referencing a DOM node, and we're able to return a `ReactDOM.createPortal`.

### Handling Our UI Requirements In a useEffect

We're going to handle all of our defined UI requirements in a single `useEffect` üòè. Let's set
things up:

```tsx
// ...

React.useEffect(() => {
  const rootContainer = document.querySelector(`#${root}`)
  const modalContainer = document.querySelector(`#${id}`)

  if (isOpen) {
  } else {
  }

  return () => {}
}, [isOpen])

// ...
```

We'll create two variables, `rootContainer` and `modalContainer`, which will each hold their
respective DOM elements, and pass `isOpen` to `useEffect`'s dependencies array, so the effect will
run each time `isOpen` changes. Let's handle what we'll need to do when our modal is opened:

```tsx
// ...
if (isOpen) {
  if (exitButton.current) exitButton.current.focus()
  if (modalContainer) toggleTabIndex('on', modalContainer)
  if (rootContainer) toggleTabIndex('off', rootContainer)
  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown)
  freeze()
}
// ...
```

What's happening here is when our `Modal` component `isOpen`, we:

1. Update the current DOM focus to the exit button that comes with our `Modal`.
2. Call `toggleTabIndex` (defined below) to enable focusability(? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) of focusable elements within our
   `modalContainer` to `0`
3. Call `toggleTabIndex` to turn off the focusability of all focusable elements in
   our `rootContainer`.
4. Add an event listener to listen of `Escape` key clicks, which will just call the `handleExit`
   callback our user provides.
5. Call `freeze` (defined below) to apply a bit of CSS magic to prevent the `document.body` from
   scrolling since our modal UI is overlaying.

Let's define what happens when `isOpen` is `false` as well as what to run on unmount:

```tsx
if (isOpen) {
  // ...
} else {
  if (modalContainer) toggleTabIndex('off', modalContainer)
  if (rootContainer) toggleTabIndex('on', rootContainer)
  window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown)
  unfreeze()

  if (focusAfterExit) focusAfterExit.focus()
}

return () => {
  if (isOpen) {
    window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown)
    unfreeze()
  }
}
```

Same thing with when our component `isOpen`, we're toggling `tabindex`, removing our keyboard event
lister, and calling `unfreeze` (defined below) to allow users to scroll the document again.

Let's define `toggleTabIndex`. It'll just be function that applies a `tabindex` to every focusable
element within a specified DOM element:

```tsx
// ...
// const modalContainer = document.querySelector(`#${root}`)

const toggleTabIndex = (type: 'on' | 'off', container: Element) => {
  const focusableElements = container.querySelectorAll(
    'button, a, input, textarea, select'
  )
  focusableElements.forEach((element: Element) => {
    if (type === 'on') {
      element.removeAttribute('tabindex')
    } else {
      element.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1')
    }
  })
}

// if (isOpen) {
// ...
```

Next, we'll define our `freeze` and `unfreeze` functions, which are actually functions returned from
a higher ordered function, with the current scroll position at the time the function was called
wrapped in a closure. This way, both `freeze` and `unfreeze` have access to the same position even
when they're called at different points in time.

```tsx
// ...
// const toggleTabIndex = (type: 'on' | 'off', container: Element) => { ... }

const capturePosition = () => {
  const cachedPosition = window.pageYOffset
  return {
    freeze: () => {
      // @ts-ignore
      document.body.style = `position: fixed; top: ${cachedPosition *
        -1}px; width: 100%;`
    },
    unfreeze: () => {
      document.body.removeAttribute('style')
      window.scrollTo({
        top: cachedPosition,
      })
    },
  }
}

const { freeze, unfreeze } = capturePosition()

// if (isOpen) {
// ...
```

Lastly, let's define our keydown event handler:

```tsx
// const capturePosition = () => {...}

const handleKeyDown = (e: any) => {
  if (e.key === 'Escape') {
    handleExit()
  }
}

// if (isOpen) {
// .../
```

### One last caveat

Sometimes I like a modal's content to transition in and out smoothly. To do so easily, I find the content
should always be in the DOM and then we apply CSS transforms/opacity to control how things move in
and out.

Because of this, I want all the content on the initial mount to not be focusable/tabbable. Currently
our `useEffect`, when run initially, won't capture the `Modal`'s content since there's nothing
before our `forceUpdate`. So everything in our effect here won't work:

```tsx
if (isOpen) {
  // ...
} else {
  //‚ùóÔ∏èOn initial mount, this will do nothing since forceUpdate has not updated our component
  if (modalContainer) toggleTabIndex('off', modalContainer)
  if (rootContainer) toggleTabIndex('on', rootContainer)
  window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown)
  unfreeze()

  if (focusAfterExit) focusAfterExit.focus()
}
```

An easy hack would be to do something like this to prevent the content
from being in the DOM at all:

```tsx
<Modal>{isShowing && <MyModalContent />}</Modal>
```

I found a way around using `setTimeout` with a delay of `0` ([Event
Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)):

```tsx
const initialRender = React.useRef(false)
// React.useEffect(() => {
// ...

if (isOpen) {
  // ...
} else {
  //if (modalContainer) toggleTabIndex('off', modalContainer)
  //if (rootContainer) toggleTabIndex('on', rootContainer)
  //window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown)
  //unfreeze()

  //if (focusAfterExit) focusAfterExit.focus()

  if (!initialRender.current) {
    initialRender.current = true
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (modalContainer) toggleTabIndex('off', modalContainer)
    }, 0)
  }
}

// ...
```

If you have come across this issue and know of a better solution, please teach me!

With that, our `Modal` component is now functioning; using React's Portal API to
render our modal content in its own unique `div`, works in a server rendered environment, handles
keyboard events, focus, and scroll management when our modal is in view.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me. I hope this helps if you run
into a similar issue with React Portals and SSR or just with hooks in general!
