brand within the industry. We worked to build a new landing page for services he provided within
personal injury."

<Description
  section="01."
  title="Simplicity"
  content="With typical law sites spilling essays worth of information, we opted for straight
forward, concise content. What are the legal services provided by Avrek Law? What are some client
experiences? Think we may be a fit? Reach out!"

  title="Details"
  content="With a single page layout, we added small visual elements to compliment the content.
Adding a fixed menu with a progress animation showing a visitor's position on the page, as well as
light parallax effects on each element allow for a pleasant overall experience."

<Description
  section="03."
  title="Accessibility & SEO"
  content="The layout is built with clear and well structured markup, allowing search engines to
easily crawl the page and for users to easily navigate throughout the page through accessibility
technologies."

Everything was built from scratch with no UI libraries!
